MolMeDB is an open chemistry database about interactions of molecules with membranes.

"Open" means that you can send your scientific data to MolMeDB and that others may freely use it. We collect information on how chemicals interact with individual membranes either from experiment or from simulations. 

How do compounds interact with membranes?
They are attracted to membranes, PMF estrone vs estriol 
they partition to membranes,
they reside in specific positions in membranes,
they penetrate through membranes, 
they change the membranes,
and many more. 

MolMeDB tries to collect and display such data in order to help understand these phenomena.
